                                <div>HASOC provides a forum and a data challenge for multilingual research on the

                                    dataset for all the tasks. All datasets are sampled from Twitter.
                                    Task-1 is offered for Marathi with 1 problem. Task-2 contains two tasks namely: Task
                                    2A offered in Hindi-English code-mix binary and Task 2B offered in German code-mix
                                    binary. Task-3 is offered in Hindi-English code
                                    mix multiclass. Participants in this year’s shared task can choose to participate in
                                    one or two of the subtasks. Participants can look at the openly available data for

                                    if given the context of the parent content.

                                    tweet have written “Amine” which means "truthfully" in
                                    Persian. Which is supporting the hate but with the context of the parent.

                                            is supporting the hate expressed in the comment. Hence,
                                            it is also hate speech.
