                <b>Overview</b>


              </h3>
            </div>
               <div class="panel-body">
<p>Social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, being user-friendly and a free source, provide opportunities for people to air their voices. People, irrespective of age group, use these sites to share every moment of their lives, making these sites flooded with data. Apart from these commendable features of social media, they also have downsides as well. Due to the lack of restrictions set by these sites for their users to express their views as they like, anyone can make adverse and unrealistic comments in abusive language against anybody with an ulterior motive to tarnish one’s image and status in society. A conversational thread can also contain hate and offensive content, which is not apparent just from a single comment or the reply to a comment, but can be identified if given the context of the parent content. Furthermore, the contents on such social media are spread in so many different languages, including code-mixed languages such as Hinglish. So it becomes a huge responsibility for these sites to identify such hate content before it disseminates to the masses.    </p>

                <b>Problem</b>


              </h3>
    </div>

<div class="panel-body">
<p> A conversational thread can also contain hate, offensive, and profane content, which is not apparent from a standalone or single tweet or comment or the reply to a comment, but can be identified if given the context of the parent content. </p>   

<div id="image">
            
            <img src="image1.png" alt="HASOC" class="center" heigh=35% width=35%>

     </div>

<p> The above screenshot from Twitter describes the problem at hand effectively. The parent/source tweet, which was posted at 2:30 am on May 11th, expresses hate and profanity towards Muslim countries regarding the controversy happening during the recent Israel-Palestine conflict. The 2 comments on the tweet have written "Amine", which means trustworthy or honest in Arabic. If the 2 comments were to be analyzed for hate or offensive speech without the context of the parent tweet, they wouldn’t be classified as hate or offensive content. But if we take the context of the conversation, then we can say that the comments support the hate/profanity expressed in the parent tweet. So those comments are labelled as hate/offensive/profane. </p>

This sub-task focused on the binary classification of such conversational tweets with tree-structured data into:
<ul>
<li>(NOT) Non Hate-Offensive - This tweet, comment, or reply does not contain any Hate speech, profane, offensive content.</li>
<li>(HOF) Hate and Offensive - This tweet, comment, or reply contains Hate, offensive, and profane content in itself or supports hate expressed in the parent tweet</li>
</ul>

            
        <div id="image">
            
            <img src="image2.png" alt="HASOC" class="center" heigh=35% width=35%>

     </div>

    Another such example with code mixed text. <br>

<ul>
<li class="li" ><b>The Source Tweet:</b>  Modi Ji COVID situation ko solve karne ke liye ideas maang rahe the. Mera idea hai resignation dedo please… </li> 

<li class="li" ><b>Translation :</b> Modi ji (PM of India) was asking for ideas to solve the covid situation of India. My idea to him is to resign. </li>  

<li class="li" ><b>The Comment:</b> Doctors aur Scientists se manga hai. Chutiyo se nahi. Baith niche. [HOF]
</li> 
<li class="li" ><b>Translation:</b> They have asked Doctors and Scientists. Not fuckers. Sit down. [HOF]
</li>
<li class="li" ><b>The reply:</b> You totally nailed it, can’t stop laughing. [HOF]</li> 
</ul>
The reply has a positive sentiment. But it is positive in favour of the hate expressed towards the author of the source tweet in the comment.
 Hence, it is supporting the hate expressed in the comment. Hence, it is also hate speech.<br><br>

This is the type of problem we’re aiming to solve via this shared task.<br><br>

<p>The sampling and annotation of social media conversation threads is very challenging. We have chosen controversial stories on diverse topics to minimize the effect of bias. We’ve hand picked controversial stories from the following topics that have a high probability of containing hate, offensive, and profane posts. </p>

<p>The controversial stories are as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li class="li" >Twitter Conflicts with the Indian Government on new IT rules.
</li>  
 <li class="li" >Casteism controversy in India
</li>  
 <li class="li" > Charlie Hebdo posts on Hinduism
</li>      
  <li class="li" > The Covid-19 crisis in India 2021
</li>     

  <li class="li" > Indian Politics ﻿
</li>   

  <li class="li" > The Israel-Palestine conflict in 2021
</li>                
  <li class="li" > Religious controversies in India
</li>                
  <li class="li" > The Wuhan virus controversy

So, we’ve decided to provide participants with a baseline model which will provide participants with a template for steps like importing data, preprocessing, featuring and classification. And the participants can make changes in the code and experiment with various settings. The code for baseline model, <a href="https://github.com/bhargav25dave1996/ICHCL_baseline">click here</a></p>
